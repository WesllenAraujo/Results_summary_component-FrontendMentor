## Updates

Updated in 09/08/2023.
## Learnings

In this practice project, I learned about flexbox functionalities, how to align tags divs and sections, apply gradient colors, and add transparent colors using HSL and RGBA in CSS.

My biggest problem is constructing the divs and sections aligned in the center of website and using a flexbox in the summary card. But i know if i practice more, i will understand how to useÂ bothÂ correctly.

## ðŸ›  Abilities
HTML (Hypertext Markup Lenguage)

CSS (Cascate Style Sheets)


## Learnings

In this practice project, I learned flexbox functionalities, how to align tags divs and sections, apply gradient colors and add transparent colors using HSL and RGBA in CSS.

My worst problem is to construct the divs and sections align in the center of website and using a flexbox in the summary's cards. But i know if i pratice more i will understand how to useÂ bothÂ correctly.
